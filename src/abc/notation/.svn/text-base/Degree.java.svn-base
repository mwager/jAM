/**
 * Constants for note degree in a scale
 * 
 * In a scale, the notes are called the
 * <UL>
 * <LI>tonic (I)
 * <LI>supertonic (II)
 * <LI>mediant (III)
 * <LI>subdominant (IV)
 * <LI>dominant (V)
 * <LI>submediant (VI)
 * <LI>leading tone (VII)
 * </UL>
 * 
 * Of these, it is most important to remember the "tonic" (I),
 * "subdominant" (IV), and "dominant" (V), because these tones
 * and chords built on these tones are used the most often.
